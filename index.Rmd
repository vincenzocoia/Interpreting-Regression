# Preamble

## The two main tasks that regression tries to solve

prediction and interpretation

Example 1: (Basic numeric example, perhaps with y in R)

Example 2: (Another numeric example, perhaps with y being a count)

Example 3: (binary response) There's a 5% that a person will get pregnant through an in-vivo insemination procedure. It's well-know that age is an important factor. It also depends on how long after the leutenizing hormone (LH) first spiked.

- Prediction: Given the person's age, what is the chance of pregnancy?
- Interpretation: How does age influence the chance of pregnancy? What about LH? What about LH for people over 40?
