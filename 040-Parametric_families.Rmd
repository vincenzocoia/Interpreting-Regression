# Parametric Families of Distributions

**Caution: in a highly developmental stage! See Section  \@ref(caution).**

Concepts:

- Common scales: Positive ratio scale, binary, (0,1)
- Different data generating processes give rise to various _parametric families_ of distributions.  We'll explain a good chunk of them. 
- These are useful in data analysis because they narrow down the things that need to be estimated. Improving estimator quality by parametric distributional assumptions and MLE
