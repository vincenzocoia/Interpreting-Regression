## Probabilistic Quantities

- Sometimes confusingly called "parameters".
- Explain the quantities by their interpretation/usefulness, using examples.
	- Mean: what number would you want if you have 10 weeks worth of data, and you want to estimate the total after 52 weeks (one year)?
	- Median: 
	- Mode:
	- High Quantile:
	- Low Quantile:
	- Extreme quantile?

When you want information about an unknown quantity, it's up to you what you decide to use. 

The mean is the most commonly sought when the unknown is numeric. I suspect this is the case for two main reasons:

1. It simplifies computations.
2. It's what's taught in school.
